				The historical building currently housing Apart-hotel Horowitz was built in the 1830s by famous Lviv
				architect Paul Eutele. The building still retains its best elements: Empire style frontage, Middle Age
				underground passageways, oak made Austrian doors and “Amour and Psyche” bas-relief above the entrance.
			</p>
			<p class="history__text content-text">
				The house was built for the Horowitzs, a prominent Galician family, which produced a lot of famous lawyers,
				doctors, musicians. Several Horowitzs were well-known rabbis in the Lviv region, but the most famous one was
				in Brody.
